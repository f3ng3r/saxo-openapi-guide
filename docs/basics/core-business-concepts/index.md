article_title: Core Business Concepts

??? abstract
    A number of key concepts form the foundation of the OpenAPI. In order to use the OpenAPI effectively, basic knowledge of these concepts and the way they interact is required.

In order to use the OpenAPI effectively, it is important to understand some of the core concepts that underlie the objects, interactions, and mechanisms that you will encounter. General understanding off these concepts is regarded 'common knowledge' for anyone that works with the OpenAPI.

Examples are provided where possible to illustrate common use cases of these concepts. Not every concept directly applies to your case as many aspects are configurable on a client level, meaning that you might not have access to some of the subjects that are discussed.

## Finding Your Way Around the OpenAPI

The OpenAPI is organized into service groups, which are collections of related services/endpoints.
